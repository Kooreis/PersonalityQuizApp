# Personality Quiz

This Python script creates a simple personality quiz. The quiz is composed of a series of questions, each with multiple choice answers. The user's responses are stored and displayed at the end of the quiz.

## Class Definitions

The script defines two classes: `Question` and `PersonalityQuiz`.

### Question Class

The `Question` class represents a single question in the quiz. It has two attributes:

- `prompt`: A string that contains the question to be asked.
- `answers`: A list of strings that represent the possible answers to the question.

### PersonalityQuiz Class

The `PersonalityQuiz` class represents the quiz itself. It has three methods:

- `__init__`: The constructor method that initializes a new instance of the quiz. It takes a list of `Question` objects as an argument and stores it in the `questions` attribute. It also initializes an empty dictionary `results` to store the user's answers.

- `take_quiz`: This method starts the quiz. It iterates over each question in the `questions` list, displays the question and possible answers, and prompts the user to select an answer. The user's answer is then stored in the `results` dictionary.

- `show_results`: This method displays the results of the quiz. It iterates over each item in the `results` dictionary and prints the question and the user's answer.

## Libraries

This script does not import any libraries.

## Usage

To use this script, create a list of `Question` objects and pass it to the `PersonalityQuiz` constructor. Then, call the `take_quiz` method on the `PersonalityQuiz` object. Here is an example:

```python
questions = [
    Question("What is your favorite color?", ["Red", "Blue", "Green", "Yellow"]),
    Question("What is your favorite animal?", ["Dog", "Cat", "Bird", "Fish"]),
    Question("What is your favorite season?", ["Spring", "Summer", "Autumn", "Winter"]),
]

quiz = PersonalityQuiz(questions)
quiz.take_quiz()
```

This will start the quiz and display the results when the user has answered all the questions.

# C# Documentation

# Personality Quiz App

This is a simple console application written in C# that conducts a personality quiz. The application asks the user a series of questions and based on the responses, it determines the user's personality type.

## Script Explanation

The script begins by defining an array of questions that will be asked to the user. It then creates an empty array of the same length to store the user's answers.

The script then enters a loop, where it asks each question to the user and stores their response in the answers array.

After all the questions have been asked, the script calculates a score based on the user's answers. Each "yes" response increases the score by one.

Finally, the script determines the user's personality type based on their score and displays the result.

## Imported Libraries

The script uses the following libraries:

- `System`: This is a built-in .NET library that provides fundamental classes and base classes that define commonly-used value and reference data types, events and event handlers, interfaces, attributes, and processing exceptions. In this script, it is used for console input/output operations.

## Code

```CSharp
using System;

namespace PersonalityQuizApp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string[] questions = new string[]
            {
                "Do you enjoy outdoor activities? (yes/no)",
                "Do you prefer reading books over watching movies? (yes/no)",
                "Do you consider yourself an introvert? (yes/no)"
            };

            string[] answers = new string[questions.Length];

            for (int i = 0; i < questions.Length; i++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(questions[i]);
                answers[i] = Console.ReadLine();
            }

            int score = 0;

            foreach (string answer in answers)
            {
                if (answer.ToLower() == "yes")
                {
                    score++;
                }
            }

            if (score <= 1)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Your personality type is: Type A");
            }
            else if (score == 2)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Your personality type is: Type B");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Your personality type is: Type C");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This script is a simple and fun way to conduct a personality quiz. It can be easily modified to include more questions or different scoring mechanisms.

# Java Documentation

# Personality Quiz App

This is a simple Java application that conducts a personality quiz. The user is asked a series of questions and based on their responses, a personality type is determined.

## How it works

The application starts by welcoming the user and explaining how to answer the questions. The user is then asked five questions, one at a time. The user's response to each question is added to a score. At the end of the quiz, the user's total score is used to determine their personality type. The user's score and personality type are then displayed.

## Code Explanation

The script is written in Java and uses the `java.util.Scanner` class from the Java Standard Library.

### Imported Libraries

- `java.util.Scanner`: This class is part of the Java Standard Library and is used for reading the user's input. In this script, it is used to read the user's responses to the quiz questions.

## Code Breakdown

1. A `Scanner` object is created to read the user's input.
2. The user is welcomed and the quiz instructions are displayed.
3. The user is asked five questions in sequence. The user's response to each question is read using the `Scanner` object and added to a score.
4. After all questions have been asked, the user's total score is displayed.
5. The user's score is then used to determine their personality type. If the score is 10 or less, the user is considered introverted and thoughtful. If the score is between 11 and 20, the user is considered balanced and adaptable. If the score is more than 20, the user is considered outgoing and expressive.
6. The user's personality type is then displayed.

## Running the Script

To run the script, you need to have Java installed on your machine. You can then compile the script using the Java compiler (`javac`) and run it using the Java interpreter (`java`).
